"If there are more than string in the control then each item is searched "

"string. Also the untranslated strings themselves are returned (all as one"
" string). These strings are not escaped and are delimited as "

"**False positive bug reports** False positive bugs will be reported in "
"the following cases. -       The title of the control stays the same as "
"the US because the translation is the same as the English text(e.g. Name:"
" in German) -       The title of the control is not displayed (and not "
"translated). This can sometimes happen if the programmer displays "
"something else on the control after the dialog is created."
