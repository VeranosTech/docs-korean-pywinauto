"**What is checked** This test checks that if a set of controls were "
"aligned on a particular axis in the reference dialog  that they are all "
"aligned on the same axis."

"**How is it checked** A list of all the reference controls that are "
"aligned is created (ie more than one control with the same Top, Left, "
"Bottom or Right coordinates). These controls are then analysed in the "
"localised dialog to make sure that they are all aligned on the same axis."

"**False positive bug reports** It is quite possible that this test "
"reports false positives: 1.      Where the controls only just happen to "
"be aligned in the reference dialog (by coincidence) 2.      Where the "
"control does not have a clear boundary (for example static labels or "
"checkboxes)  they may be miss-aligned but it is not noticeable that they "
"are not."
