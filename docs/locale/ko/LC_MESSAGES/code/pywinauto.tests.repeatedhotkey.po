"**Bug Extra Information** The bug contains the following extra "

"is repeated between the 2 controls converted to uppercase, String "
"CharsUsedInDialog       This is a list of all the hotkeys used in the "
"dialog, String AllCharsInDialog        This is a list of all the "
"characters in the dialog for controls that have a hotkeys, String "
"AvailableInControlS     A list of the available characters for each "
"control. Any of the characters in this list could be used as the new "
"hotkey without conflicting with any existing hotkey."

"**Is Reference dialog needed** The reference dialog does not need to be "
"available. If it is available then for each bug discovered it is checked "
"to see if it is a problem in the reference dialog. NOTE: Checking the "
"reference dialog is not so exact here! Only when the equivalent controls "
"in the reference dialog all have the hotkeys will it be reported as being"
" in the reference also. I.e. if there are 3 controls with the same hotkey"
" in the Localised software  then those same controls in the reference "
"dialog must have the same hotkey for it to be reported as existing in the"
" reference also."

"**False positive bug reports** There should be very few false positives "
"from this test. Sometimes a control only has one or 2 characters eg "
"\"X:\" and it is impossible to avoid a hotkey clash. Also for Asian "
"languages hotkeys should be the same as the US software so probably this "
"test should be run on those languages."
