"**How is it checked** Various tests are performed on each pair of "
"controls to see if any of the above conditions are met. The most specific"
" tests that can be performed are done 1st so that the bugs reported are "
"as specific as possible. I.e. we report that 2 controls are not exactly "
"overlapped when they should be rather than jut reporting that they are "
"overlapped which contains less information."
