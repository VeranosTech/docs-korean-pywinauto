"This test checks whether the format for shortcuts/hotkeys follows the "
"standards for localised Windows applications. This format is {localised "
"text}({uppercase hotkey}) so for example if the English control is "
"\"&Help\" the localised control for Asian languages should be "
"\"LocHelp(H)\""

"After checking whether this control displays hotkeys it examines the 1st "
"string of the control to make sure that the format is correct. If the "
"reference control is available then it also makes sure that the hotkey "
"character is the same as the reference. Controls with a title of less "
"than 4 characters are ignored. This has been done to avoid false positive"
" bug reports for strings like \"&X:\"."
