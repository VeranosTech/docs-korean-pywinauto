"A GUI application behaviour is often unstable and your script needs "
"waiting until a new window appears or an existing window is "
"closed/hidden. pywinauto can flexibly wait for a dialog initialization "
"implicitly (with the default timeout) or explicitly using dedicated "
"methods/functions that could help you to make your code easier and more "
"reliable."

"This method is useful for multi-threaded interfaces that allow a lazy "
"initialization in another thread while GUI is responsive and all controls"
" already exist and seems ready to use. So waiting for a specific window "
"existence/state is useless. In such case the CPU usage for the whole "
"process indicates that a task calculation is not finished yet."
